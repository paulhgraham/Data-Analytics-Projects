This is a new creation of a document that was previously made but was deleted with a bad repository along with the write up 
file submitted prior to 6/7/18 at 11:54pm. I then spent time reviewing the solution to retype my previous observable trends.

1. In regards to gender, men outnumbered the purchase of the game at 81% but had the second highest average purchase price. The
players that decided not to disclose their gender had a slightly higher average purchase price of $3.25 over the $2.95 of men.
This would be an interesting trend to investigate further because if more data could be found as to why these individuals
spend more on average, implementing a way to increase the average spend across the board will result in substantially more revenue. 

2. A trend that I found while observing the data was how this data needs to be cleaned and reviewed more in depth. When finding 
the most popular items, it became obvious that the item price X item count didn't equal the total amount listed for Final Critic.
This is concerning, and was confirmed in other filters of data that inconsistent data and trends started to arise. The best approach 
to investigate and correct these discrepancies should be done to provide more accurate conclusions. 

3. The majority age range of users is between 15 and 29 with almost half of players between 20-24 years old. 
This trend in the data allows game creators to understand their target demographic. Therefore, for future games developers should
look to include references and preferences to these age groups. If developers wanted to substantially profit from new games,
they would look to the future 15-29 year olds and cater more to their desires and not consider as much of the interests of those
who are currently 29 as an example.
